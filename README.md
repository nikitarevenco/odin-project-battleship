# Battleship

This project was made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum as part of learning web development. I am leaving these projects up and public for anyone who would want to see my journey to becoming a software engineer. 

## What I Learned

- Learned how to unit test.
- Learned and used more advanced object-oriented patterns.
- Learned how to maintain a proper separation of concerns between code that is responsible for the game logic vs code that is responsible for manipulating the DOM.
- Learned how to use the native browser drag and drop API.

## Features

- Semi-intelligent AI
- Two player mode
- Drag and drop ships

## Running locally

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.
